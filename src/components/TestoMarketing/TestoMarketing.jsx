        <div className="paragrafo">
          <h2>Customer Value Proposition</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        Not just benefits, but the promise of value to be delivered, communicated, and acknowledged by a customer with a given service, product, or experience. Value proposition defines the area of differentiation versus competitors, highlights where a product or service shines above others, and sets up the path for success.

        <div className="paragrafo">
          <h2>Customer Benefits</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        No customer will buy into an idea, a product, or a service, or support an initiative if there are no benefits at stake. It's crucial to formulate what these are in a way that is trustworthy, credible, and transparent to instill the need for purchasing, funding, or even advocating for a brand's services or products.
