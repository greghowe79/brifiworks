        <h2>So, what is content strategy?</h2>
	  </div>
	  <div className="paragrafo">
      Content strategy is an uprising discipline that lays between journalism and content marketing. It’s responsible for satisfying business requirements, whether for profit or non-profit goals, throughout the definition, creation and distribution of content. Most importantly, content strategy tells the people what they want or need to know, how they want to know it, in ways that are trustworthy and time-efficient.

      Understanding the target audience, beyond their own cognitive needs, supports the craft of a strategy that anticipates and fulfils the audience’s motivation and wants.

      A brand is not just a name, a logo, or a visual; it embeds the experience that is lived through the use of a product, a service, an initiative, or a system of values we want to promote, engage or influence a target audience with. Starting from the core values of our customers, we support them to develop a distinctive voice and tone: that includes expressing their unique personalities through vocabulary, visuals, and recognisable graphic choices to set them apart.
