          <h2>So, What is Content Strategy?</h2>
      </div>
      <div className="paragrafo">
      Content strategy is an uprising discipline that falls between journalism and content marketing. It’s responsible for satisfying business requirements, whether for-profit or non-profit goals, through the definition, creation, and distribution of content. Most importantly, content strategy tells  people what they want or need to know and how they want to know it, in ways that are trustworthy and time-efficient.

      Since its introduction, the role of a content strategist has been subject to multiple interpretations by different providers. Here’s what we do at Brifiworks:

        <h2>Understand the Clients's Goals</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        A content strategy can only be formulated by understanding the client's objectives first. We help to determine or refine the client's content goals and address existing issues that would benefit from a content solution.

        <div className="paragrafo">
        <h2>Content Audit</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        To confirm whether a strategy addresses our clients' goals, we start by assessing existing content, the process and governance that lead to content generation, and maintenance. Together, we set the path for successful content that meets our clients’ target audiences or markets.
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        <h2>Know your Audience</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        Understanding the target audience, beyond their own cognitive needs, supports the craft of a strategy that anticipates and fulfils the audience’s motivation and wants. We research and analyse psychographic information as well as demographics, develop personas, and give our customers a complete picture of the shots that make up with their target audience.    
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        <h2>Brand Identity</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        A brand is not just a name, a logo, or a visual; it embeds the experience that is lived through the use of a product, a service, an initiative, or a system of values we want to promote, engage, or influence a target audience with. Starting from our clients' core values, we support them to develop a distinctive voice and tone that includes expressing their unique personalities through vocabulary, visuals, and recognisable graphic choices to set them apart.
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        <h2>Channel Strategy</h2>
      </div>
        <div className="paragrafo">
        Once content exists and is ready to be shared, we identify suitable channels for reaching the target audience. That might be through social channels, email outreach, organic search, traditional media, or any number of other channels.
